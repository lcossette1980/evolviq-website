# Regression Tool Fix Summary

## Issue: "Training still in progress" for Background Tasks
When more than 3 models were requested for training, the system would trigger background processing but the results would never become available, always returning "Training still in progress".

## Root Cause
The `train_models_background` function in `backend/main.py` was only simulating work with `await asyncio.sleep(10)` instead of actually performing model training.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Backend - Fixed Background Training (main.py)
- Replaced simulated training with actual model training
- Background task now properly:
  - Retrieves session data and validates it exists
  - Gets preprocessed data if available
  - Restores feature_columns from preprocessing
  - Applies the configuration from the request
  - Calls the actual `workflow.train_models()` method
  - Saves results with 'training_complete' status

### 2. Frontend - Reduced Default Models (ModelTraining.js)
- Changed default models from 5 to 3: `['linear', 'ridge', 'random_forest']`
- This avoids triggering background processing for typical use cases
- Users can still select more models if needed

## Testing
Created and ran `test_regression_fix.py` which confirms:
- Background training properly updates status from 'training_in_progress' to 'training_complete'
- Training results are properly saved to session storage
- Results are accessible after training completes

## Files Modified
1. `/backend/main.py` - Fixed `train_models_background` function
2. `/src/components/regression/ModelTraining.js` - Reduced default models to 3
3. `/docs/PRODUCTION_TODO.md` - Documented the fix

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ Background training actually trains models instead of simulating
✅ Results are available after background training completes
✅ Session status properly transitions to 'training_complete'
✅ Default configuration avoids unnecessary background processing
